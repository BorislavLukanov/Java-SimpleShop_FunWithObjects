# Java-SimpleShop_FunWithObjects
Created with Eclipse This is a simple demo project for practice and have fun with objects. 
The securuty ot the current code should be reviewed because even if all classes are with default access if the package is imported they could be directly accessed. 
This is why the passing of a boolean is implemented on every method to make possible the check of successfull authentication in case of class access as a back door. 
But this is not the definitive implementation of such technique because it can still be passed a true boolean when calling the class without needing the authentication.

This demo is intended for future practice and having fun. For example the interfaces are showing ideas for future updates and use of Python etc.
